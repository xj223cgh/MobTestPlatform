# Window Arrangement Feature

> Note: The Window Arrangement feature has been removed.

## Feature Status

The Window Arrangement feature has been removed from the Escrcpy application. This feature was previously used to manage the layout of multiple device windows through a visual drag-and-drop interface, including:

- Simultaneously managing the layout of multiple device windows
- Adjusting window positions and sizes through drag-and-drop
- Setting global default configurations and device-specific configurations
- Previewing window layout effects in real-time
- Saving and loading custom layout schemes

## Removal Reason

To simplify the application structure and improve performance, the project decided to remove the Window Arrangement feature, focusing on core device mirroring and control functionality.

## Alternative Solutions

Device window positioning and sizing are now managed automatically by the system or controlled through scrcpy command-line parameters. For custom window behavior, it is recommended to use scrcpy's native command-line parameters directly.
